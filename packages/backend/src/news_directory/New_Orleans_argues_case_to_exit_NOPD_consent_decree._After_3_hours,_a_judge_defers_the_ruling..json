After 3 hours, a judge defers the ruling.\nBY MISSY WILKINSON and JOHN SIMERMAN | Staff writers Jun 28, 2023\n2 min to read\nBuy Now\nThe U.S. District Courthouse in New Orleans.\nSTAFF FILE PHOTO\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nAlmost a year after filing a motion to end the sprawling reform agreement that has governed the New Orleans Police Department for a decade, Mayor LaToya Cantrell had her day in court.\nAttorneys for the city on Wednesday argued that problems the original federal consent decree was designed to address, including corruption, bias and shoddy policing, have long been ameliorated, despite consistent assertions that the police force should do more. \nU.S. Department of Justice lawyers disagreed, citing ongoing shortcomings that include improper use of force by officers and patterns of unlawful racial discrimination in stops and searches. \nAfter three hours of back-and-forth, U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan said she would take the matter under advisement.\nThe hearing culminated a legal gambit by Cantrell that began last August, when the city filed its motion to exit the deal, casting doubt on the assessments by the federal monitors who report to Morgan. In recent reports, the monitors identified backsliding in areas they'd previously checked off as compliant.\nMorgan had projected that the city would reach a two-year offramp from federal oversight last summer. But that timetable dissolved as the judge and the monitors began to find progress stifled, in part by a steep loss of police officers from the force. Morgan pumped the brakes, stoking a bitter response from Cantrell, who has since taken an aggressive tack against the judge and monitors, in court and public statements.    \nCharles Zimmer, outside counsel for the city, told Morgan Wednesday that the NOPD has shown substantial compliance with the demands of the 2012 consent decree, which at the time was the most wide-reaching blueprint for police reform in the country.\nZimmer argued that changes have rendered compliance more onerous, and that perfection shouldn't be the goal. \n\"The city believes the pattern that existed in 2011 has been remedied for years, and we are legally entitled to exit,\" said Daniel Davillier, outside counsel for the city.\nAccording to a review by Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment, 17 of the 28 instances in which the NOPD used force in 2021 weren't justified, and 37% of police pursuits that year resulted in formal disciplinary investigations. The NOPD's own audit revealed 35% of pat-downs from March 2022 weren't properly documented\u2014a potential Fourth Amendment violation.\nThough the department has exhibited enormous progress, that doesn't equate to full and effective compliance, a DOJ representative argued. \nFormer Mayor Mitch Landrieu agreed to the reforms after a blistering federal investigation portrayed a police department replete with misconduct. Morgan and the monitors have touted improvements since then, though doubts over the will to sustain those efforts remain strong.    \n\"This is supposed to be a durable remedy,\" Morgan told the city's attorney. \"Once you're in compliance, the concept is you stay in compliance\u2014not that you can be compliant for two years and then forget about it.\"\nThe exchange between Morgan and Zimmer grew heated when Zimmer likened federal oversight\u2014and the accompanying $16 million paid out to federal monitors over the years\u2014to \"a hostage situation.\"\n\"I do not want you to impugn the integrity of the court to my face,\" Morgan replied.\nCziment, whose office is slated to take on a bigger watchdog role once the feds leave, cited fear in the community over a premature exit from federal oversight, and uncertainty over an NOPD left to its own devices.\n\"There isn't a clear vision of what constitutional policing will look like after the consent decree is done,\" Cziment stated after the hearing. \"As for the use of force and stop, searches and arrests, we share the concerns highlighted by the Department of Justice and the NOPD themselves (via departmental audits.)\"\nMorgan provided no timeline for her ruling.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nMORE INFORMATION\nMayor defends reinstatement of Jeffrey Vappie to security detail\nSeven months after questions arose about his time spent with Mayor LaToya Cantrell in a French Quarter apartment, New Orleans police officer J\u2026\nNOPD says officer on Cantrell detail violated policies, but monitor says it could've looked harder\nFederal monitors cast a dim view of the New Orleans Police Department\u2019s internal investigation of Officer Jeffrey Vappie over his timesheets while serving on a team securing Mayor LaToya Cantrell, in a report released Thursday.\nNOPD to sell reforms straight to public after federal judge caves on hearing order\nNew Orleans Police Department brass were set to launch a series of public meetings on Wednesday to tout progress on a slew of reforms to the f\u2026\nIn police reform quarrel, New Orleans objects to 'unattainable' goal\nCantrell administration says Justice Department, \"faced with losing control\" is changing the rules\nMonitor slams NOPD over internal affairs, probe of Cantrell security guard\nA New Orleans police internal affairs probe into alleged payroll irregularities involving an officer who was assigned to protect Mayor LaToya \u2026\nCity must defend NOPD probe of mayor's bodyguard, appeals court rules\nA federal appeals court on Monday opposed the city\u2019s objection to a rule to show cause hearing regarding alleged violations of the consent decree that stemmed from its handling of the Vappie probe.
