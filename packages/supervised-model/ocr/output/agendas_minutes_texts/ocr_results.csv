Brief:
Requesting a Text Amendment to create a definition and use standards for ""Electric Vehicle

with the following considerations:
* Consider updating existing regulations in the

proposed parking lots (principal use) or parking
structures (principal use) based off national best
practices;

to zoning districts with existing auto-oriented uses
or consider ways to mitigate any potential negative
impacts of this auto-oriented use.
The proposed Text Amendment would affect regulations that are applied to all zoning
districts. The recommendation of the City Planning Commission being ""FOR MODIFIED
APPROVAL"".

Brief:
Directing the City Planning Commission to conduct a public hearing to consider amending
and re-ordaining the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance No. M.C.S. 4264, as
amended by Ordinance No. 26,413 M.C.S. and subsequent amendments) to expand
community solar opportunities with the following considerations:
i. Consider defining a ""Community Solar Project"" as ""a solar
energy system constructed and operated by a public or
private entity that connects directly to the electricity
distribution network and converts solar energy into
electricity and/or stores energy for the primary purpose
of serving electric demands offsite from the facility.
Community solar projects may allow multiple local
subscribers to purchase or lease ownership shares
or a percentage of the power produced on the site.""
ii. Consider creating accessory use standards for ""Community
Solar Projects,"" which may include minimum lot size
requirements, setbacks, design standards, and/or landscaping
requirements.
iii. Consider amending Article 21.6.J of the Comprehensive
Zoning Ordinance to read as follows:
""1. A collective alternative energy system such as
a community solar project, wind energy system,
or geothermal energy system is permitted to be
constructed upon one or more properties owned
by a neighborhood organization, homeowners
association, institutional campus, religious institution,
non-profit organization, or a public entity. Collective
alternative energy systems shall be permitted as
accessory use for the purpose of serving electric
demands on- site or offsite from, but related to, the
2. A collective alternative energy system may be
constructed on one or more contiguous lots owned
by a neighborhood organization, homeowners association,
institutional campus, religious institution, non-profit
organization, or a public entity. Where collective
alternative energy systems are constructed on two
or more contiguous lots, all owners shall agree to such
arrangement. The agreement shall be recorded as a
""collective alternative energy servitude"" on each plat
of survey to grant access to all participants to maintain
equipment. A management plan shall be submitted and
servitude recorded. The management plan shall clearly
detail the relationship between the accessory Collective
Alternative Energy System use and the related on-site
or off-site principal use or uses.

6/23/23, 5:38 PM
3. Collective Alternative Energy Systems shall be built in
accordance with accessory use standards for the particular
type of energy system used, as described in this section.
A management plan shall be submitted to the Department
of Safety and Permits. The management plan shall clearly
detail the relationship between the accessory Collective
Alternative Energy System use and the related on-site or

Brief:
Recognizing the late Wade Thomas Verges for his services to the community and various non-
profit organizations. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and surrounding
parishes. Envisioning the need for major business outlets and smaller ""mom and pop""
businesses to return to the community, Wade worked tirelessly to facilitate the economic
resurgence of the area. With a heavy heart, determination, and a strong work ethic, Wade
reinvested money and time to revitalize Eastern New Orleans. He believed in the East where
his office and major buildings are located.
